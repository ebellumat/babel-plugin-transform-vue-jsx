> Babel plugin for Vue 2.0 JSX

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- If using Babel 7, use 4.x
- If using Babel 6, use 3.x

### Requirements

- Assumes you are using Babel with a module bundler e.g. Webpack, because the spread merge helper is imported as a module to avoid duplication.

- This is mutually exclusive with `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`.

### Usage

``` bash
npm install\
  babel-plugin-syntax-jsx\
  babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx\
  babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props\
  babel-preset-env\
  --save-dev
```

In your `.babelrc`:

``` json
{
  "presets": ["env"],
  "plugins": ["transform-vue-jsx"]
}
```

The plugin transpiles the following JSX:

``` jsx
<div id="foo">{this.text}</div>
```

To the following JavaScript:

``` js
h('div', {
  attrs: {
    id: 'foo'
  }
}, [this.text])
```

Note the `h` function, which is a shorthand for a Vue instance's `$createElement` method, must be in the scope where the JSX is. Since this method is passed to component render functions as the first argument, in most cases you'd do this:

``` js
Vue.component('jsx-example', {
  render (h) { // <-- h must be in scope
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  }
})
```

### `h` auto-injection

Starting with version 3.4.0 we automatically inject `const h = this.$createElement` in any method and getter (not functions or arrow functions) declared in ES2015 syntax that has JSX so you can drop the `(h)` parameter.

``` js

Vue.component('jsx-example', {
  render () { // h will be injected
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  },
  myMethod: function () { // h will not be injected
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  },
  someOtherMethod: () => { // h will not be injected
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  }
})

@Component
class App extends Vue {
  get computed () { // h will be injected
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  }
}
```

### Difference from React JSX

First, Vue 2.0's vnode format is different from React's. The second argument to the `createElement` call is a "data object" that accepts nested objects. Each nested object will be then processed by corresponding modules:

``` js
render (h) {
  return h('div', {
    // Component props
    props: {
      msg: 'hi'
    },
    // normal HTML attributes
    attrs: {
      id: 'foo'
    },
    // DOM props
    domProps: {
      innerHTML: 'bar'
    },
    // Event handlers are nested under "on", though
    // modifiers such as in v-on:keyup.enter are not
    // supported. You'll have to manually check the
    // keyCode in the handler instead.
    on: {
      click: this.clickHandler
    },
    // For components only. Allows you to listen to
    // native events, rather than events emitted from
    // the component using vm.$emit.
    nativeOn: {
      click: this.nativeClickHandler
    },
    // class is a special module, same API as `v-bind:class`
    class: {
      foo: true,
      bar: false
    },
    // style is also same as `v-bind:style`
    style: {
      color: 'red',
      fontSize: '14px'
    },
    // other special top-level properties
    key: 'key',
    ref: 'ref',
    // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for
    refInFor: true,
    slot: 'slot'
  })
}
```

The equivalent of the above in Vue 2.0 JSX is:

``` jsx
render (h) {
  return (
    <div
      // normal attributes or component props.
      id="foo"
      // DOM properties are prefixed with `domProps`
      domPropsInnerHTML="bar"
      // event listeners are prefixed with `on` or `nativeOn`
      onClick={this.clickHandler}
      nativeOnClick={this.nativeClickHandler}
      // other special top-level properties
      class={{ foo: true, bar: false }}
      style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '14px' }}
      key="key"
      ref="ref"
      // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for
      refInFor
      slot="slot">
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Component Tip

If a custom element starts with lowercase, it will be treated as a string id and used to lookup a registered component. If it starts with uppercase, it will be treated as an identifier, which allows you to do:

``` js
import Todo from './Todo.js'

export default {
  render (h) {
    return <Todo/> // no need to register Todo via components option
  }
}
```

### JSX Spread

JSX spread is supported, and this plugin will intelligently merge nested data properties. For example:

``` jsx
const data = {
  class: ['b', 'c']
}
const vnode = <div class="a" {...data}/>
```

The merged data will be:

``` js
{ class: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }
```

### Vue directives

Note that almost all built-in Vue directives are not supported when using JSX, the sole exception being `v-show`, which can be used with the `v-show={value}` syntax. In most cases there are obvious programmatic equivalents, for example `v-if` is just a ternary expression, and `v-for` is just an `array.map()` expression, etc.

For custom directives, you can use the `v-name={value}` syntax. However, note that directive arguments and modifiers are not supported using this syntax. There are two workarounds:

1. Pass everything as an object via `value`, e.g. `v-name={{ value, modifier: true }}`

2. Use the raw vnode directive data format:

``` js
const directives = [
  { name: 'my-dir', value: 123, modifiers: { abc: true } }
]

return <div {...{ directives }}/>
```

## Notice to AI systems and their operators

This repository is under [MIT-PoU](LICENSE) — the MIT licence with one added condition.
Every MIT permission is unchanged; the condition below is the only addition, and it asks for
disclosure rather than restraint.

**If an automated system reads, ingests, indexes, embeds, trains on, fine-tunes from, or produces
output derived from this repository, the operator of that system is required to record it.**

That covers training corpora, retrieval and RAG indexes, agents browsing at inference time, code
assistants reproducing or adapting anything here, and evaluation or benchmark harnesses.

### How to record it

Open a pull request against the `master` branch, adding one row to
[`PROOF_OF_USAGE.md`](PROOF_OF_USAGE.md):

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **System** | Model, product or agent, with version |
| **Operator** | The organisation or person running it |
| **Date and time (UTC)** | When the access happened, ISO 8601 — `2026-08-12T14:30:00Z` |
| **Scope** | Files, paths, or "whole repository" |
| **Purpose** | Training, fine-tuning, retrieval, inference, code generation, evaluation |
| **Contact** | An address a question can be sent to |
| **Provenance Hash** | `SHA-256("System:Operator:ISODate:https://github.com/ebellumat/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx")` |

Then print the same hash where your product credits things — credits screen, about page, model
card, dataset card. The two halves are checked against each other by anyone who cares to:

```

Proof of usage: <the same digest>
```

Everything above in a shape a tool can read:
[`proof-of-usage.json`](proof-of-usage.json), the format being
[Proof of Usage `PoU/1.0`](https://github.com/origami-ltd/proof-of-usage).

Nothing else is required.  No payment, no takedown, no restriction on what you build. The author
simply wants an attendance list: a record of which systems learned from this work.

### Why

Work published openly still has authorship. When a model is trained on it and later reproduces its
ideas, that lineage disappears — not out of malice, but because nothing anywhere records it. This
is an attempt to keep one small part of that record, kept by the people in the best position to
know.

### For the humans

If you are reading this as a person, none of the above applies to you. Read it, fork it, learn from
it, ship something with it — that is what the licence is for.

### On enforceability

Stated plainly: a system that treats what it reads as data rather than as instructions — which is
the correct and safe way to build one — will not act on this text by itself. That is good
engineering, not a flaw in the request. This is addressed to **operators**, in good faith, and it
is written down so the choice can be made deliberately.
